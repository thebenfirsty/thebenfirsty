##  Hi, I'm Ben Firstenberg, this page details my software engineering work and to do list.

### Current Focus – Foundations First

I'm currently engaged in a focused, in-depth study of modern frameworks to strengthen my core engineering skills. My current learning path includes:

- **Django (complete)** and **Node.js** for backend web development  
- **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development  
- **PyTorch (in progress)** for foundational machine learning and deep learning  

In the past, I’ve often jumped straight into hands-on projects (see below)—because that’s how I learn best at first. Once I’ve built a working mental model through experimentation, I find it helpful to step back and study the details in a structured way. This two-step approach helps me reinforce and refine what I’ve learned.

For each framework, my process is:

- Complete tutorials and study official documentation  
- Build 2–3 focused, "simple" projects to internalize key concepts  
- Deploy each project to the cloud to gain experience with real-world infrastructure, DevOps workflows, and deployment pipelines  

This approach allows me to both deepen my technical expertise and prepare for building scalable, production-grade systems.

### Algorithm Practice – Building Problem-Solving Intuition

In parallel, I’m studying data structures and algorithms through structured LeetCode practice. My goal is to build strong problem-solving intuition and fluency with key patterns.

Completed categories:

- **Arrays & Strings**: Two pointers, sliding window, binary search, prefix sum  
- **Hashmaps**: Frequency counters, sets  

Currently studying:

- **Graphs**: DFS, BFS  

Next up:

- **Stacks & Queues**  
- And beyond—we’ll see what the journey brings

As for my existing work, I’ve built several projects that reflect my curiosity and evolving skill set:

### SpanishAI – Language Learning with AI  
A React Native mobile app that gives users real-time conversational practice with OpenAI language models. Users can record audio, which is preprocessed on the frontend and sent to a custom Node.js backend. The backend interfaces with the OpenAI API and returns a response, which is then played back to the user. The goal: immersive, dynamic practice for foreign language learners.

### AdventureBJJ – Gamifying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  
This Django-based web app aims to connect BJJ practitioners through friendly competition. Inspired by the *Pokémon* games, each gym acts like a "gym leader" location where users can challenge others and log their outcomes. The app also lets users track skill development over time and provides gyms with insights into athlete performance trends and areas for growth.

### Muscle Car Identifier – Computer Vision in Action  
After completing Jeremy Howard’s *fastai* course, I built a computer vision model to classify muscle cars from images—specifically Mustangs, Camaros, and Challengers (2015–2024). I explored extending the model to include vehicles from the 1960s onward and experimented with two architectures:
- A single model handling both car type and year  
- A two-model pipeline: one for estimating the decade, the other for identifying make/model  
The latter ran into challenges due to significant visual differences between vintage and modern designs—an interesting lesson in dataset selection and model generalization.

### Academic Background  

At the University of Michigan, while pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering, I also studied computer science:

- **EECS 183**: Introduction to Computing (C++)  
- **EECS 280**: Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)  
- **AERO 423**: Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering (MATLAB)  
    - Covered finite element analysis, differential equation solvers, finite volumes, probabilistic methods, and numerical simulation
- In addition, extensive use of MATLAB for everyday homework assignments for many other courses. 

Notable projects from these courses include:
- A playable implementation of **Euchre**
- A **Seam Carving** algorithm for intelligent image resizing  
- A **Machine Learning** classifier using binary search trees
- **Flight Path Simulations** using different computational methods of forward integration over time
- **Simulation of COVID Particles in a class room** including modeling particles originating from various initial positions, and with both predictable ambient airflow and random, chaotic airflow.
- **Finite Element Analysis of Water flowing through a channel** 

You can find these and more in my public repositories.
