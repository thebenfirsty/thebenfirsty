## üëã Hi, I'm Ben Firstenberg

I'm currently focused on deepening my understanding of core programming principles, with an emphasis on:

- Software engineering fundamentals  
- Data structures and algorithms  
- Framework documentation  
- In-depth tutorials and deployment practices  
- Cloud services and DevOps fundamentals  

My learning is hands-on, and I‚Äôve built several projects that reflect my curiosity and evolving skill set:

---

### üó£Ô∏è SpanishAI ‚Äì Language Learning with AI  
A React Native mobile app that gives users real-time conversational practice with OpenAI language models. Users can record audio, which is preprocessed on the frontend and sent to a custom Node.js backend. The backend interfaces with the OpenAI API and returns a response, which is then played back to the user. The goal: immersive, dynamic practice for foreign language learners.

### ü•ã AdventureBJJ ‚Äì Gamifying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  
This Django-based web app aims to connect BJJ practitioners through friendly competition. Inspired by the *Pok√©mon* games, each gym acts like a "gym leader" location where users can challenge others and log their outcomes. The app also lets users track skill development over time and provides gyms with insights into athlete performance trends and areas for growth.

### üöó Muscle Car Identifier ‚Äì Computer Vision in Action  
After completing Jeremy Howard‚Äôs *fastai* course, I built a computer vision model to classify muscle cars from images‚Äîspecifically Mustangs, Camaros, and Challengers (2015‚Äì2024). I explored extending the model to include vehicles from the 1960s onward and experimented with two architectures:
- A single model handling both car type and year  
- A two-model pipeline: one for estimating the decade, the other for identifying make/model  
The latter ran into challenges due to significant visual differences between vintage and modern designs‚Äîan interesting lesson in dataset selection and model generalization.

### üß† Academic Background  

At the University of Michigan, while pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering, I also studied computer science:

- **EECS 183**: Introduction to Computing (C++)  
- **EECS 280**: Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)  
- **AERO 483**: Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering (MATLAB)  
    - Covered finite element analysis, differential equation solvers, finite volumes, probabilistic methods, and numerical simulation

Notable projects from these courses include:
- A playable implementation of **Euchre**
- A **Seam Carving** algorithm for intelligent image resizing  
- A **Machine Learning** classifier using binary search trees

You can find these and more in my public repositories.
