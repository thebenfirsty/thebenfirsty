## Hi there, I'm Ben Firstenberg

I'm currently working on Coding Fundamentals.
I want to make myself a better engineer by formally studying framework documentations, data structures and algorithms, in depth tutorials and deployments to cloud services. 

In the past, I've launched headfirst into projects such as my SpanishAI react native app, which aimed to leverage OpenAI language models to give users real world, real time practice for the foreign language they were studying. Users could record audio, then the front end react native app would preprocess the recording, send it to a Node.js backend I wrote and deployed, call OpenAI's API, get a response and then play it for the user. 

Another project was my AdventureBJJ app, which is aiming to connect Brazilian Jiu Jitsu players through friendly competition. Borrowing the idea from Pokemon games from the late 2000s, I thought each real life Jiu Jitsu gym could act like a Pokemon Gym. Users could visit and challenge locals to friendly sparring sessions and record the winners. Users could also track skill development by logging skills successfully used during challenges. This would game-ify the sport, encourage people from different locations to connect, and give gyms real time data about the performance of their athletes and their strengths and weaknesses. I am primarily making this app in Python Django. 

One last project to highlight was my Muscle Car Identifier. After taking Jeremy Howard's "FastAI" course, I built a basic computer vision model to identify whether an image was of a 2015-2024 Mustang, Camaro or Challenger. I had hoped to extend the model to include cars from 1960-2024. I had also hoped to compare model performance from two different setups: one with one large model to handle all the features and a second with two smaller models: one to identify the approximate age and one to identify the car type. I ran into trouble though, I suspect because 1960s cars are too distinct from modern day cars to provide any real comparison. 

As you can see, my experience to date has skewed towards projects. In addition, I took EECS 183: Introduction to Computing and EECS 280: Data Structures and Algorithms at the University of Michigan while purusing my Aerospace Engineering degree. In addition to those two C++ courses, I took AERO 483: Computational Methods of Aerospace Engineering, a MATLAB based course that taught methods such as Finite Element Analysis, time integration of differential equations, finite volumes, probabilistic methods and simulations. From those three courses, notable projects included:
